Added an attack placeholder
Added an Icon for the knight character
Added an Icon for the lives that the knight uses

Made changes to the player, Changes:
Switched the key presses from E to F
*Added an int called life to keep track of the lives a player object has. Not going to use the built in varable lives as that's a global variable 
shared across all instances. Each player should have their own life. 
*Added a bool, has died, to check if the player is out of lives
*Created an alarm 0 
*Alarm 0 "properly" respawns the player.


Other notes:
The obj_block and obj_death are currently visable. They will not be in later builds. They are there as funtionaity and might be replaced.
